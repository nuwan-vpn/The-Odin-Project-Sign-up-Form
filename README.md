## Set up and planning

1. Set up your git repository (refer to past projects if you need a refresher).
2. Set up your HTML and CSS files with some simple dummy content, just to make sure you have everything linked correctly.
3. Download a full-resolution copy of the design file and get a general idea of how you’re going to need to lay things out in your HTML document.

## Gather assets

1. Find and download an image for the large background section. You can use unsplash.com or choose your own image. Be sure to credit the creator of your chosen image.
2. Pick an external font for the ‘logo’ section. Norse Bold was used in the design, but you can use any font you like.
3. Replace the Odin logo in the image-sidebar with an image of your choice.

## Tips

- Start by scaffolding out the structure of the page and then tackle various sections one by one.
- The area behind the “ODIN” logo should have a div with a dark, semi-transparent background color for enhanced text readability against the busy background image.
- The 'Create Account' button should have a color similar to tones found in the background image (#596D48).
- Default inputs should have a very light border (#E5E7EB). Password inputs should be given an error class. Selected inputs should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow using the :focus pseudo-class.
- Do not focus on mobile responsiveness, but ensure the project looks decent at different desktop resolutions.
